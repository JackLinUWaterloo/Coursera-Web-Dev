CSS preprocessors: Less and Sass
    -CSS is great for defining styles and repeatedly applying them to various
     HTML elements
    -CSS is limited when it comes to features like defining variables, nesting
     selectors, expressions, functions
     -which affects maintainability

    -Less, Sass(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), and Stylus come in to play
    -all are compiled into traditional CSS syntax automatically before use in
     a web page

    -typical CSS preprocessors features variables, nesting selectors, mixins,
     functions and expressions

    Less variable: @variableName: something

    Sass variable: $variableName: something

    -using the variables:
        -height: @lessVar/$sassVar

    -they both have variable scopes

    -mixins
        -hold multiple CSS declarations unlike variables
        -used inside other css classes to reduce redundancy
        -variables are allowed

    -mathematical operations are allowed as well
    -as well as imports
