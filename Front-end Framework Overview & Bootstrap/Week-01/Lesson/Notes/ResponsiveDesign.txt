Responsive design:
  -why do so?
    -users increasingly accessing websites from a variety of devices of
     different screen sizes
    -one size fits all no longer a possibility
    -adapt to the users' 'viewport'
      -build it into the core of the site

  -mobile first design
    -first satisfy the mobile constraints then adapt to larger screen sizes

  -foundation for responsive design
    -grid system
    -fluid images
    -media queries
      -CSS technology to apply some style based on the size of the viewport
        -e.g.
          @media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
            /*CSS styles customized for desktop*/
          }
