Web Tools:
    Task Runners:
        -web dev involves a lot of repetitive tasks
        -the DRY (do not repeat yourself) principle
        -need for build tools to automate tasks

    CSS Tasks:
        -compiling Sass or Less into CSS
        -running Autoprefixer to add any vendor prefixes that are needed

        comments) from source code without compromising functionaltiy
        -concatenation

        -JSHint: checking JS code for errors and potential problems(static code
        analysis)
        -concatenation

        -configure the tasks once, and rerun it automatically as many times as needed
        -server task runners out there: grunt, gulp...
        -build systems for the web

    Grunt: configuration over code
    Gulp: code over configuration
